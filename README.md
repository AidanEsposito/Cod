<strong style="font-size: larger;">COD</strong>

Have you ever loved fishing but can't bring your fishing love to the world of programming? 
This problem can be seen all around the world with fishermen and woman struggling to make
their dreams a reality. Now, today is the day to make those dreams come true. Introducing 
the COD language which is a class based statically typed language based around the theme of 
fishing! COD was based on a love for fishing and its ideas and therefore integrates fishing
lingo and ideas throughout the language syntax. This language also has a wide variety of features
not limited to:

- Statically Typed
- Class based
- Complete lack of ;
- Left to Right argument evaluation
- Use of Public and Private type ideas for hiding
- Forever, while, for, and number of time loops
- Break and Continue like statements
- Functions with a type
- Possible specific character types
- Possible class types
- AND MORE (please leave ideas professor)

Some Examples for this magnificent language include:

Static Checking in Cod:

* mustNotAlreadyBeDeclared: Checks if an identifer is already declared and prevents it from being called twice

* mustHaveBeenFound: Checks if an identifier can be found throughout the code

* mustHaveNumericType / mustHaveBooleanType / mustHaveNumericOrStringType / cannotAssignNumberToVoid / mustHaveIntegerType
  / mustHaveStructType / mustHaveArrayType: Checks for specific types throughout programs

* mustBothHaveTheSameType: Checks if comparing two types results in all elements having the same type

* mustBeAType: Checks for specific types

* incudesAsField: Checks whether the struct type has a field of type type, directly or indirectly

* mustNotBeSelfContaining: Checks if a struct is not self containing

* mustBeAssignable: Checks if a variable with specific types can be assigned to

* mustNotBeReadOnly: checks if something is read only

* mustHaveDistinctFields: Checks if fields in functions and sets are distinct

* mustBeInLoop: Checks if break is in a loop

* continuMustBeInLoop: Checks if continue is in loop

* mustBeInAFunction: Checks if return is in a function

* mustNotBeInFunction: Checks that classes can't be made inside functions

* mustBeCallable: Checks that structs and functions are able to be called

* mustNotReturnAnything: checks if return type is void and makes sure nothing can be returned

* mustReturnSomething: Checks that if a function is not void, it can return something

* mustBeReturnable: Checks if a variable or function is returnable

* mustHaveCorrectArgumentCount: checks if a function has the correct amount of arguments desired and makes sure they work 
  properly

*mustNotBeInAPrivateClass: Makes sure public classes can't be made in private classes.
